import java.util.*;
public class Sum{
    public static void main(String args[]){
 Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
 System.out.println("enter number one ");
 int num1=sc.nextInt();
System.out.println("enter number two");

System.out.println(sum);

    }
}

THIS PROGRAM TAKES INPUT FROM THE USER TO GIVE SUM AS OUTPUT NOW IF WE WANT TO GET THE SUM 100 TIMES WE CANNOT PRATICALLY WRITE THE SAME PIECE OF CODE AGAIN AND AGAIN 
BECAUSE IF THERE IS A CHANGE IN PROGRAM WE HAVE TO CHANGE IT IN EVERY PIECE OF CODE 100 TIMES WHICH IS NOT EFFECIENT PRACTICE 
TO REUSE THE SAME PIECE OF CODE FOR A NUMBBER OF TIMES WE CREATE A FUNCTION / METHOD IN JAVA 
METHOD IN JAVA IS DEFINED IN A CLASS AND IS INVOKED BY THE METHOD NAME 

import java.util.*;
public class Sum{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        sum();                             //calling out or invoking function as many times we want without repeating the code 
        sum();
    }
    static void sum(){                    // declaring a function sum which takes input from users and performs operation of addition 
 Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);       // making object of scanner class 
 System.out.println("enter number one ");
 int num1=sc.nextInt();                   //input 
 System.out.println("enter number two");
 int num2=sc.nextInt();                   //input 
 int sum= num1+num2;
 System.out.println(sum);

    }
}



NOW INSTEAD OF PRINTING THE SUM 
WE TAKE SUM AS A RETURN TYPE 
WE WILL RETURN THE VALUE OF SUM 

IN THIS EXAMPLE WE CREATE A REFRENCE VARIABLE CALLED AS ANS TO HOLD THE RETURN VALUE OF SUM 
the void will get replaced by int as a return type as  we return a value 



import java.util.*;
public class Sum{                             // we can call the function as many times we want it without repeating code 
    public static void main(String args[]){
        int ans=sum();                       //the value returned from sum method gets assigned to refrence variable ans  
       System.out.println(ans);              // and then it gets printed 
    }
    static int sum(){                        // return type changes to int 
 Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
 System.out.println("enter number one ");
 int num1=sc.nextInt();
System.out.println("enter number two");
 int num2=sc.nextInt();
int sum= num1+num2;
return sum; 

    }
}

THIS PROGRAM TAKES INPUT FROM THE USER TO GIVE SUM AS OUTPUT NOW IF WE WANT TO GET THE SUM 100 TIMES WE CANNOT PRATICALLY WRITE THE SAME PIECE OF CODE AGAIN AND AGAIN 
BECAUSE IF THERE IS A CHANGE IN PROGRAM WE HAVE TO CHANGE IT IN EVERY PIECE OF CODE 100 TIMES WHICH IS NOT EFFECIENT PRACTICE 
TO REUSE THE SAME PIECE OF CODE FOR A NUMBBER OF TIMES WE CREATE A FUNCTION / METHOD IN JAVA 
METHOD IN JAVA IS DEFINED IN A CLASS AND IS INVOKED BY THE METHOD NAME

        sum();
    }
    static void sum(){                    // declaring a function sum which takes input from users and performs operation of addition
